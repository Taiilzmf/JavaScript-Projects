# JavaScript-Projects
This repository will include javascript coding projects
In our javascript course we used javascript, html, and css to create multiple websites including a pizza ordering site and a clock site. We completed
math challenges, timers/ countdowns, and created a "dictionary" of my family. We worked with if , and else statements and loops.
We also created multiple image slideshows and pop up forms.
