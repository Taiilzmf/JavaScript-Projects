# The Tech Academy Javascript Projects

This repository holds all of my Javascript assignments. 
I created a basic pizza menu with selectable objects and pizza quote.
I also created a Tic tac Toe game for 1 player with bot second player.
We also created a virtual calculator and a customizable to do list. We worked in AJAX and
JQuery as well.
